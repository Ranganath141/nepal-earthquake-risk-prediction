# Nepal-earthquake-risk-prediction
ML model to predict multi-class classification earthquake damage risk

## Problem Statement
Predict damage risk level (low to high) caused by earthquakes using building and location attributes.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance
- Model training using XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree
- Model evaluation using Macro F1-score and Accuracy

## Results
- Macro F1-score: 0.71
- Accuracy: 0.75

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Pandas, NumPy

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
